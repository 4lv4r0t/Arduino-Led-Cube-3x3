# Arduino-Led-Cube-3x3
A small proyect from my school's science fair. The circuit is the average led cube 3x3 circuit with
arduino uno so if you use this code you won't be finding so much trouble on it, just make shure you connected
the right pins as my led cube's (maybe taking a look at the code and different internet images
would help). This cube has just 4 simple sequences made up mostly of "for loops" (not a big deal tbh)
